This project produces a raspberry pi static website that is used in a rugby club to have a carousel display of a dozen images. The images will be upcoming events, club notices, scores, and a few select photos.

The raspberry pi will be plugged into a tv, and display the carousel.

We want to have a simple but secure way of uploading new content. Ideally this would run a pipeline that helps to prepare the images so that they display optimally on the tv.
